# Matrix_Project
A program to do different Matrix operations using C++ Language. The program use a certain input string format to represent the matrix and the output will be the same format . The string representation of the Matrix is : [0 2.53 7;-5 4 4;10.5 5 9] for a 3*3 Matrix  as an example it also support complex matrices for( add , subtract and multiply ). In the program, the user enters a matrix in the defined string format then he is asked to enter an operator from the following operators  + , - , * , D (for determinant) , I (for Inverse) , T(for Transpose) , ^(for Power)  to get his output.
